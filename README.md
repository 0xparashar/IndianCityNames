# Indian City Names

Store of Indian City name in Native Indian Languages
The aim of this crowdsourcing of project is to create a database of cities in India with names in each major language of India, which will in turn help the developer community to create more personal and easy to use products for Indian public.


I would really encourage everyone to come and contribute as much as you can, import this csv file in excel and fill in as much as you can, let's build a foundation of better regional apps ecosystem in India.

Create a pull request for new cities or new entries in one of the languages you want to contribute to, PR will be verified by me, initally, later on the control will fall into the hands of community members.
